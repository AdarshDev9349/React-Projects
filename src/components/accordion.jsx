      title: "Why use React?",
      content: "React is flexible, efficient, and declarative. It uses a virtual DOM to improve performance and allows for building complex applications with ease."

    {
      title: "How do you use React?",
      content: "You use React by creating components. Components can be either class-based or function-based, and they help divide the UI into independent, reusable pieces."
    },
    {
      title: "What are React Hooks?",
      content: "Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Common hooks include useState, useEffect, and useContext."

      title: "What is JSX?",
      content: "JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows you to write HTML-like syntax in your JavaScript files. JSX gets compiled to React.createElement() calls behind the scenes."

      title: "What is a Virtual DOM?",
      content: "The virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the real DOM. React uses it to detect changes and update only the parts of the UI that changed, improving performance."

    {
      title: "What is the difference between props and state?",
      content: "Props are read-only and passed from parent to child, while state is managed within the component. State can be updated using the setState function or useState hook."
    },
    {
      title: "What is lifting state up?",
      content: "Lifting state up is the process of moving shared state to a common ancestor component to allow sibling components to access and update the state."
